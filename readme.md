## SDI-12 to USB Type-B Adapter Board PCB
KiCAD project for an adapter powered by a common STM32G431 series microcontroller chip using the on-chip USB capabilities to communicate with a PC relying on VCOM CDC option, to allow for an easy communication.

Current revision includes bidirectional 5V - 3.3V level shifting without logical voltage level inversion. This ensures compability of SDI standard with TTL logic. All of the parts have been standarized and designated manufacturer is JLCPCB. Project includes index.html as BOM listing.
